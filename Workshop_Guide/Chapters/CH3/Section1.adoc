=== Introduction to AAP 2.x Components

With Ansible 2.x, many new items have emerged. Ansible can now leverage execution environments which contain Ansible collections, different versions of Ansible, and the correct python versions and modules needed to execute a playbook. Ansible Execution Environments (EEs) allow developers and administrators more flexibility be leveraging a containerized Ansible environment. The use of Ansible EEs from a control node or developer workstation will work exactly the same with Ansible Controller (formerly known as Ansible Tower). Ansible Controller allows Ansible EEs to be assigned to projects, inventories, job templates, and more.

Ansible Private Automation Hub (Automation Hub) allows a self-hosted Ansible Galaxy. The local installation of Ansible Galaxy not only allows collections to be published privately within an organization, but it also provides a container registry for publishing custom Ansible EEs.

Ansible Content Navigator is a new tool that can be used to test and develop Ansible playbooks.


==== Ansible Content Navigator

The *ansible-navigator* tool replaces and extends the functionality of the *ansible-playbook*, *ansible-inventory*, *ansible-config* commands and more. Ansible Content Navigator allows the Ansible Control Node to be separated from the execution environment as playbooks are now run in a container. This makes it easier to move from development environments to production environments as the execution environment is now a portable container.

Ansible Content Navigator is works very similar to *ansible* and *ansible-playbook* commands as it relies on a configuration file. The *ansible-navigator.yml* file utilizes the *ansible.cfg* file and further provides customizations for configurations on developing, testing, and running playbooks in your Ansible project. Some of the most critical components of Ansible Navigator are the following:

* *ANSIBLE_CONFIG*: Specifies Ansible configuration file to use
* *image*: Specifies Ansible Execution Environment (EE) to be used


.*ansible-navigator.yml*
[source,yaml]
----
---
ansible-navigator:
  execution-environment: <1>
    enabled: true
    environment-variables:
      set:
        ANSIBLE_CONFIG: ansible.cfg <2>
    image: hub.lab.example.com/ee-29-rhel8:latest <3>
  logging:
    level: critical
  mode: stdout <4>

----
<1> Configures Ansible Navigator to use an Execution Environment (EE)
<2> Specifies where Ansible Navigator and the Ansible EE will receive Ansible configuration settings
<3> Specifies Ansible EE to use for Ansible Navigator
<4> Specified Mode, in this case, we are using *STDOUT* so that the output will look like it does with the *_ansible-playbook_* command.

Most *ansible* commands have a corresponding *ansible-navigator* command. The table below provides a mapping for the most commonly used commands.

==== Ansible Execution Environments

Ansible Execution Environments (EEs) are containers whci consist of:

* *Ansible Core*
* *Ansible Content Collections*
* *Python Libraries*
* *Executables*
* Other dependencies for running the playbook

Custom execution environments can be built and created with *ansible-builder*. The process of creating a new Ansible EE depends on if there is a valid Ansible Automation Entitlement associated with your account. If you are using the *free* version of Ansible, base container images *MUST* come from *Quay.IO* as the Red Hat Ansible Execution Environments (EEs) cannot be used or redistributed.

.Default Versions of Ansible and Execution Environments
[IMPORTANT]
======
Ansible Automation Platform 2 provides Ansible Core 2.11 as well as several Red Hat Certified Content Collections providing a similar experience to Ansible 2.9. A benefit of execution environments is that they can be used to run older versions of Ansible. Some of the demos in this webinar will use an Ansible EE based on Ansible 2.9 so that collection mapping is done automatically and older playbooks don't need to be touched.
======


.DEMO - *Using Ansible Content Navigator and the Ansible 2.9 Execution Environment*
====

. Change to correct directory
+
[source,bash]
----
[student@workstation ~]$ cd /home/student/Github/AAP_Webinar/Future/Navigator
----


. View configuration for Ansible Content Navigator
+
[source,bash]
----
[student@workstation Navigator]$ cat ansible-navigator.yml
---
ansible-navigator:
  execution-environment:
    enabled: true
    environment-variables:
      set:
        ANSIBLE_CONFIG: ansible.cfg <1>
    image: hub.lab.example.com/ee-29-rhel8:latest <2>
  logging:
    level: critical
  mode: stdout <3>
----
<1> Ensure it is pointing to the project *ansible.cfg*
<2> Ensure we are using the Ansible EE based on Ansible version 2.9.x for compatibility of existing playbooks (pre-collections).
<3> Ensure mode is specified as *stdout* so that the output can easily be viewed from the command-line (CLI).
